            <h2>Why get into coding?</h2>
            <p>
                The story behind my coding career went back when I was in middle school. At that time, 
                I was playing this online games in a community called Project:LA. During that time, 
                I don't know what coding is until I was offered to try it out since they needed coders
                to help them with basic functionality in the script. During that time, the language
                that they use to code the server was called PAWNO, which I think was a specialized 
                language to build script for the game. Since then, my love for coding grew and here I am
            </p>
            <p>The story goes more than that, but that's just a quick overview how I got my hands dirty
                with coding.
